All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.<br>
除了一个孩子，所有的孩子都会长大。他们很快就知道自己会长大，温迪就是这样知道的。两岁时的一天，她在花园里玩耍，又摘了一朵花跑到妈妈身边。我想她的样子一定很可爱 因为达林太太把手放在她的心口上 哭着说："哦，你为什么不能永远这样呢！" 这就是她们之间在这个问题上的全部对话，但温迪从此知道，她必须长大。你总是在两岁之后才知道。两岁是结束的开始。


Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.<br>
达林太太第一次听说彼得是在整理孩子们的思绪时。每一位好母亲都会在孩子们入睡后，在他们的头脑中翻箱倒柜，把第二天早上要做的事情整理好，把白天乱放的东西重新放回原处。

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
<br>
如果你能保持清醒（当然你做不到），你就会看到自己的母亲在做这件事，你会觉得看她做这件事非常有趣。就像整理抽屉一样。我想，你会看到她跪在地上，幽默地看着你的一些东西，不知道你到底从哪里捡到这个东西，让人发现甜的和不那么甜的东西，把这个东西贴在她的脸颊上，好像它就像一只小猫一样可爱，然后匆匆忙忙地把那个东西藏起来，不让人看见。清晨醒来，你上床睡觉时的淘气和邪恶的激情已经被折叠得很小，放在了你心灵的最底层，而在你心灵的最上层，精美的衣服上，则铺满了你更美丽的想法，随时可以让你穿上。

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.<br>
我不知道你是否见过一个人的思维导图。医生有时会给你的其他部分画地图，你自己的地图也会变得非常有趣，但如果让他们给一个孩子画一幅心灵地图，他不仅会感到困惑，还会一直转圈。上面有之字形的线条，就像你在卡片上的温度一样，这些可能是岛上的道路，因为梦幻岛总是或多或少有一些岛屿，这里和那里都有令人惊讶的色彩斑斓，还有珊瑚礁和看起来很褴褛的小船，还有野蛮人和孤独的巢穴，还有大多是裁缝的侏儒，还有河流穿过的洞穴，还有有六个哥哥的王子，还有一间快要腐烂的小屋，还有一个很小的老太太，她的鼻子是钩形的。如果地图上只有这些，那就太简单了，但地图上还有上学第一天、宗教、父亲、圆池塘、针线活、谋杀、绞刑、动词助动词、巧克力布丁日、戴牙套、九十九、自己拔牙三便士等等，这些要么是岛屿的一部分，要么是另一张地图的穿透，一切都相当混乱，尤其是没有任何东西是静止不动的。


Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.<br>
当然，梦幻岛也有很多不同。比如约翰的 "梦幻岛 "有一个泻湖，泻湖上有火烈鸟飞过，约翰正在向火烈鸟射击，而迈克尔还很小，他的 "梦幻岛 "却有一个火烈鸟和泻湖飞过。约翰住在沙地上一艘翻转的小船里，迈克尔住在假发屋里，温迪则住在用树叶巧妙地缝在一起的房子里。约翰没有朋友，迈克尔晚上有朋友，温迪有一只被父母遗弃的宠物狼，但总的来说，梦幻岛上的人都很像一家人，如果他们站成一排，你就可以说他们的鼻子是一样的，等等。在这些神奇的海岸上，玩耍的孩子们总是把他们的小船停在岸边。我们也曾到过那里；虽然我们将不再登陆，但我们仍能听到海浪的声音。


Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.<br>
在所有令人垂涎的岛屿中，梦幻岛是最舒适、最紧凑的，它并不宽敞，你知道的，一个探险和另一个探险之间的距离很远，但却非常紧凑。当你在白天用椅子和桌布玩耍时，它丝毫不会让你感到惊慌，但在你入睡前的两分钟里，它就会变得非常真实。这就是为什么要有夜灯。

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.<br>
达林太太在游历孩子们的心灵时，偶尔会发现一些她无法理解的东西，其中最令人困惑的就是彼得这个词。她不知道有彼得这个人，但约翰和迈克尔的脑海里却时不时地浮现出他的身影，而温迪的脑海里也开始到处都是他的身影。这个名字比其他任何一个字都要醒目，达林太太看着它，觉得它有一种奇怪的狂妄自大的样子。
